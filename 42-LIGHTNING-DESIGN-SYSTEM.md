# Lightning Design System
- The Design System makes it easy for you to build applications that comply with the new Salesforce Lightning look and feel without reverse engineering the UI as custom CSS. 
- the new Design System markup results in pages which have the Lightning look and feel without writing any CSS.
- The CSS is fully namespaced with the `slds-` prefix and scoped with the `slds-scope` class to avoid CSS conflicts.
- Modern versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox are fully tested. For Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE), the Design System supports only version 11 as well as Microsoft Edge. Users of earlier versions of MSIE might encounter issues such as missing icons.

## Four types of resources
1. `CSS framework` — Defines the UI components, such as page headers, labels, and form elements, a grid layout system, and a single-purpose helper classes, to assist with spacing, sizing, and other visual adjustments.

2. `Icons` — Includes PNG and SVG (both individual and spritemap) versions of our action, custom, doctype, standard, and utility icons.

3. `Font` — Salesforce Sans font

4. `Design Tokens` — These design variables allow you to tailor aspects of the visual design to match your brand. Customizable variables include colors, fonts, spacing, and sizing.

## Core Design Principles
- `Clarity` — Eliminate ambiguity.
- `Efficiency` — Streamline and optimize workflows.
- `Consistency` — Create familiarity and strengthen intuition by applying the same solution to the same problem.
- `Beauty` — Demonstrate respect for people’s time and attention through thoughtful and elegant craftsmanship.
