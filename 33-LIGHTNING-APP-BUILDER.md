## Lightning Page
- A Lightning page is a custom layout that lets you design pages for use in the Salesforce mobile app or Lightning Experience.
- A Lightning page is composed of regions that contain components.
- Lightning pages contain:
  1. Lightning Components
  2. Global Actions
- Lightning pages support these components:
  1. Standard Components - Lightning components built by Salesforce.
  2. Custom components - Lightning built by you or someone else have created.
  3. Third-Party Components on AppExchange - The AppExchange provides packages containing components already configured and ready to use in the Lightning App Builder.

## Lightning Components
- A Lightning component is a compact, configurable, and reusable element that you can drag and drop onto a Lightning page in the Lightning App Builder.


## Lightning Page Types
1. App Page
- Use an app page to create a home page for a third-party app that you can add directly into the Salesforce mobile app and Lightning Experience navigation menus. Your users then have an app home page where they can quickly access the most important objects and items.

2. Home Page
- Create Home pages with features relevant to specific types of users, and assign the customized pages to different user profiles. Custom Home pages are supported in Lightning Experience only.

3. Record Page
- With a record page, you can create a customized version of an object’s record page, tailoring it to your users’ needs. Custom record pages are supported in Lightning Experience only.
